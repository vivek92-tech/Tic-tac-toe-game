"""
This program contains the logic of tic tac toe game along with the following custom methods 
play_tick_tac_toe() - main logical flow of the program
display_board() - to display the current status of the board
clear_board() -  to clear the board and put spaces on each place
place_maker() - to place the player symbol on the board
winner() - to declare the winner between player-1 and player-2
game_result() - to check if there is a winner between player-1 and player-2
select_symbol() - to assign symbol 'x' or 'o' to player-1 and remaining choice symbol to player-2
select_position() - to select the rows and column in between 1-3 for current player
play_again() - checks if user wants to play the game again

Note: I am not going to use enumeration class members in my program because my logic dosen't require given template enumeration variables with those pre defined values
